# Cold Brew Coffee

> Simple recipe for making your own cold brew coffee

## Ingredients

- Ground coffee beans | 15g x mulitplier
- Tap water | 1 cup (~237ml) x multiplier
- Sealable glass container | 2 - insure containers can hold 1 cup x (multiplier + 1) in volume

## Instructions

Using either pre-ground, or freshly ground coffee beans, measure out coffee in a ratio of 15g of ground coffee per 1 cup (~237ml) of water. For reference, using a multiplier of 7 should make ~8 cups of coffee. 

Combine ground coffee and water in a glass container, seal, and store in a fridge for 18-24 hours.

Remove the mix from the fridge, stir in the coffee grounds that have settled in along the top, and let sit for 5 minutes to allow grounds to settle.

Pour the mix through a fine sieve (optionally with a cheese cloth over top) into a second container. Coffee can be stored for up to a week in the fridge.

Serve by combining equal parts filtered concentrate with cold tap or filtered water.
